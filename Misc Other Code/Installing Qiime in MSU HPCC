## The following code describes how to downloading QIIME and use in the MSU HPCC.

# First, install anaconda3 on home directory. From the following link (https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/linux/), install the installer on to home directory (download onto desktop, then scp to home directory of HPCC).

#second, type the following command:
bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-5.3.0-Linux-x86_64.sh

#third, type the following command:
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/anaconda3/bin

#next, install qiime. Although I specified qiime1.8.0 here, it was actually 1.9.0 that was installed.
conda create -n qiime1.8.0 python=2.7 qiime matplotlib=1.4.3 mock nose -c bioconda





# Once Qiime is installed, anytime you want to use QIIME, youâ€™ll need to reactivate your qiime environment:
source activate qiime1.8.0

# to print config file:
print_qiime_config.py -t

#To exit the Qiime environment:
source deactivate



####DANGER CODE BELOW

# To COMPLETELY DELETE the Qiime environment and its packages, deactivate the environment then run the following: 
conda remove --name qiime1 --all
