# AlanBowsher_LooseCode
R code and analysis used throughout my postdoctoral work in the Shade lab that was not included a published work. 

However, much of the code deposited here is for analysis of experiments that ARE previously published (Bowsher,Kearns, and Shade 2019. 16S rRNA:rDNA ratios and cell activity staining reveal consistent patterns of soil microbial activity. mSystems https://doi.org/10.1128/mSystems.00003-19). Specifically, the R code here was for extra that analyses Ashley, Alan, or Nejc needed for various presentations that were NOT included in that publication.

The code is separated into two files:
1) The bean drought/excess nutrients/control experiment.
2) The corn soil drying/rewetting/phytohormone experiment.


3) the 'Misc Code' directory includes other miscellaneous code that was NOT related to the mSystems publication
